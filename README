	diFonts 0.9 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/difonts/>

WHAT IS DIFONTS?

  A PHP script that takes a URL linking to "any text here.png" and creates an
  image of that text on first access. You can customize the font, shadow,
  size, etc. of all images and modify them at any time. Ideal for blog post
  titles, headings, buttons, etc.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * The ability to specify and use any TTF font file on the web.

 * Size, max-length, and drop-shadow all easily customizable.

 * Ability to create multiple "presets" each with its own customizations.

 * Includes optional custom PHP function to automatically generate W3C
   standards compliant HTML for you with proper alt tags and fall-back.

 * Included function automatically reformats HTML outputted IE6 to
   allow PNG transparency.

 * Optional caching support so the same exact image is never generated twice.

 * No Flash, JavaScript, or special browser font embed hackery required.
