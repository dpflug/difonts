REQUIREMENTS:

 * Apache 2+ Web server configured with MultiViews

 * PHP5 with iMagick/GD support

INSTALLATION:

 1. Place the script on your server (perhaps under your usual graphics or images
		folder).

 2. Edit settings in difonts.php to your liking and create as many presets as
    you want by duplicating options with differing names in []'s after the variables.

 3. (Optional but highly reccomended) If caching is on (default) then create a
    folder named "cache" in the same folder as difonts.php and chmod it 777.

 4. Open http://yoursite.com/images/difonts/preset/sometexthere.png and verify
    everything is happy.

 5. Format all the headers on your site to use diFonts images with alt-text
    instead of just text or use the included diFonts function.

NOTES:

 diFonts function syntax is as follows:

   <?php diFonts('Your Text Here','Preset','Optional Title Text') ?>

	Where "Preset" is whatever is in []'s after a block of options in difonts.


 Example usage in a title section of a WordPress template:

   <?php require_once('path/to/difonts.php') ?>
	 <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php diFonts(the_title()','h2') ?>
	 </a></h2>

diBlog supports diFonts out of the box, just simpily turn it on and tell it
where difonts.php is located :-).
